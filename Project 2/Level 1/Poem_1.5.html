    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      still, living like they orbit one another, my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enoughfor a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired, <br />
      
      she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season, talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl— the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues. grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.<br />
    </p>
    
    <p>
      when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love? will i go taking somebody’s hand, my skin becoming their skin? the digital age is taking away our winters,<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate, that waste waits for a wet kiss, carbon calls me pretty, and i think death is a good first date.<br />
      
      i hope when the world ends it leaves them be, spares grandpa and his game, grandma spinning corn into weight,<br />
      
      the two of them reeling into western theme songs, the TV louder than whatever’s coming.<br />
