    <h1><center>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</center></h1>
  
    <p>
      <center> still, living like they orbit one another, </center><br /> 
      <center>my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon </center><br />
      <center>assigned by some gravitational pull.they have loved</center><br />
      <center>long enough for a working man to retire. grandma says she's</center><br />
      <center>she's not tired,she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season</center><br />
      <center>,talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl— the subject salvaged by the tent</center><br />
      <center>for their tongues. grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.when</center><br />
      <center>the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love? will i go taking somebody’s hand,</center><br />
      <center>my skin becoming their skin? the digital age is taking away our winters,and i’m afraid</center><br />
      <center>the sun is my soulmate,that waste waits for a wet kiss,carbon calls me pretty, and i</center><br />
      <center>think death is a good first date. i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</center><br />
      <center> spares grandpa and his game,grandma spinning corn into</center><br />
      <center> weight,the two of them reeling into western theme</center><br />
      <center> songs, the TV louder than </center><br />
      <center>whatever’s coming.</center><br />
