    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      still, living like they orbit one another,<br /> 
      my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his <br />
      moon assigned by some gravitational pull.<br />
      they have loved long enough for a working <br />
      man to retire. grandma says she's not tired,<br />
      she wears her husband like a coat that survives <br />
      every season,talks about him the way my parents <br />
      talk about vinyl— the subject salvaged by the tent<br />
      of their tongues. grandma returns to her love like <br />
      a hymn, marks it with a color. when the world ends <br />
      will it suck the earth of all its love? will i go <br />
      taking somebody’s hand,my skin becoming their skin?<br />
      the digital age is taking away our winters,and i’m <br />
      afraid the sun is my soulmate,that waste waits for <br />
      a wet kiss,carbon calls me pretty, and i think death <br />
      is a good first date. i hope when the world ends it <br />
      leaves them be, spares grandpa and his game,grandma <br />
      spinning corn into weight,the two of them reeling <br />
      into western theme songs, the TV louder than <br />
      whatever’s coming.<br />
