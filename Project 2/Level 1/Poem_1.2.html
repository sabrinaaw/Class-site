    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      <center> still, living like they orbit one another, </center><br /> 
      <center>my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon </center><br />
      <center>assigned by some gravitational pull.they have loved</center><br />
      <center>they have loved long enough for a working </center><br />
      <center>man to retire. grandma says she's not tired,</center><br />
      <center>she wears her husband like a coat that survives </center><br />
      <center>every season,talks about him the way my parents </center><br />
      <center>talk about vinyl— the subject salvaged by the tent</center><br />
      <center>of their tongues. grandma returns to her love like </center><br />
      <center>a hymn, marks it with a color. when the world ends </center><br />
      <center>will it suck the earth of all its love? will i go </center><br />
      <center>taking somebody’s hand,my skin becoming their skin?</center><br />
      <center>the digital age is taking away our winters,and i’m </center><br />
      <center>afraid the sun is my soulmate,that waste waits for </center><br />
      <center>a wet kiss,carbon calls me pretty, and i think death </center><br />
      <center>is a good first date. i hope when the world ends it </center><br />
      <center>leaves them be, spares grandpa and his game,grandma </center><br />
      <center>spinning corn into weight,the two of them reeling </center><br />
      <center>into western theme songs, the TV louder than </center><br />
      <center>whatever’s coming.</center><br />
