            <div id="intro"><center>still, living like they orbit one another,
              my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned
              by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough
              for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired, </center><br> </div>
            <br>
            <div id="part001"><center>she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,
              talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—
              the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.
              grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color. </center><br> </div>
            <br>
            <div id="part002"><center>when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?
              will i go taking somebody’s hand,
              my skin becoming their skin?
              the digital age is taking away our winters,</center> <br> </div>
            <br>
            <div id="part003"><center>and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,
              that waste waits for a wet kiss,
              carbon calls me pretty, and i think
              death is a good first date. </center><br> </div>
            <br>
            <div id="part004"><center> hope when the world ends it leaves them be,
              spares grandpa and his game,
              grandma spinning corn into weight,the two of them reeling into western
              theme songs, the TV louder
              than whatever’s coming.</center><br> </div>
