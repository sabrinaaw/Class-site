      still, <br />
      living <br />
      like <br />
      they <br />
      orbit one another,<br />
      my <br />
      grandfather,<br /> 
      the planet, <br />
      & grandma, <br />
      his <br />
      moon <br />
      assigned<br />
      by <br />
      some <br />
      gravitational <br />
      pull. <br />
      they <br />
      have <br />
      loved <br />
      long <br />
      enough<br />
      for <br />
      a <br />
      working <br />
      man <br />
      to <br />
      retire. <br />
      grandma <br />
      says <br />
      she’s <br />
      not <br />
      tired,<br />
      she <br />
      wears<br />
      her <br />
      husband <br />
      like <br />
      a <br />
      coat <br />
      that <br />
      survives <br />
      every <br />
      season,<br />
      talks <br />
      about <br />
      him <br />
      the <br />
      way <br />
      my <br />
      parents <br />
      talk <br />
      about <br />
      vinyl—<br />
      the <br />
      subject <br />
      salvaged <br />
      by <br />
      the <br />
      tent <br />
      of <br />
      their <br />
      tongues.<br />
      grandma <br />
      returns <br />
      to <br />
      her <br />
      love <br />
      like <br />
      a <br />
      hymn, <br />
      marks <br />
      it <br />
      with <br />
      a <br />
      color.<br />
      when <br />
      the <br />
      world <br />
      ends <br />
      will <br />
      it <br />
      suck <br />
      the <br />
      earth <br />
      of <br />
      all <br />
      its <br />
      love?<br />
      will <br />
      i <br />
      go <br />
      taking <br />
      somebody’s <br />
      hand,<br />
      my <br />
      skin <br />
      becoming <br />
      their <br />
      skin?<br />
      the <br />
      digital <br />
      age <br />
      is <br />
      taking <br />
      away <br />
      our <br />
      winters,<br />
      and<br /> 
      i’m <br />
      afraid <br />
      the <br />
      sun <br />
      is <br />
      my <br />
      soulmate,<br />
      that <br />
      waste <br />
      waits <br />
      for <br />
      a <br />
      wet <br />
      kiss,<br />
      carbon <br />
      calls <br />
      me <br />
      pretty, <br />
      and <br />
      i <br />
      think<br />
      death <br />
      is <br />
      a <br />
      good <br />
      first <br />
      date.<br />
      i <br />
      hope <br />
      when <br />
      the <br />
      world <br />
      ends <br />
      it <br />
      leaves <br />
      them <br />
      be,<br />
      spares <br />
      grandpa <br />
      and <br />
      his <br />
      game,<br />
      grandma <br />
      spinning <br />
      corn <br />
      into <br />
      weight,<br />
      
      the <br />
      two <br />
      of <br />
      them <br />
      reeling <br />
      into <br />
      western<br />
      theme <br />
      songs, <br />
      the <br />
      TV <br />
      louder<br />
      than <br />
      whatever’s <br />
      coming.<br />
