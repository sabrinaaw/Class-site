      than whatever’s coming. <br>
      theme songs, the TV louder<br>
      the two of them reeling into western<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      grandma spinning corn into weight,<br>
      spares grandpa and his game,<br>
      i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,<br>
    <p>
    </p>
      death is a good first date.<br>
      carbon calls me pretty, and i think<br>
      that waste waits for a wet kiss,<br>
      and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,<br>
    <p>
    </p>
      the digital age is taking away our winters,<br>
      my skin becoming their skin?<br>
      will i go taking somebody’s hand,<br>
      when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.<br>
      the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.<br>
      talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—<br>
      she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,<br>
      by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough<br>
      my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned<br>
      still, living like they orbit one another,<br>
