  <div class="typing-demo">
    still, living like they orbit one another,</br>
    my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned</br>
    by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough</br>
    for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,</br>
    
    she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</br>
    talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—</br>
    the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.</br>
    grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.</br>
    
    when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</br>
    will i go taking somebody’s hand,</br>
    my skin becoming their skin?</br>
    the digital age is taking away our winters,</br>
    
    and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</br>
    that waste waits for a wet kiss,</br>
    carbon calls me pretty, and i think</br>
    death is a good first date.</br>
    
    i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</br>
    spares grandpa and his game,</br>
    grandma spinning corn into weight,</br>
    
    the two of them reeling into western</br>
    theme songs, the TV louder</br>
    than whatever’s coming.</br>
