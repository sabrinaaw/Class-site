<h1>the world is about and my grandparents are in love</h1>
<p class="p1">still, living like they orbit one another,</br>
  my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned</br>
  by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough</br>
  for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,</p></br>
<p class="p2">Tshe wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</br>
  talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—</br>
  the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.</br>
  grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.</p></br>
<p class="p3">when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</br>
  will i go taking somebody’s hand,</br>
  my skin becoming their skin?</br>
  the digital age is taking away our winters,</p></br>
  <p class="p1">and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</br>
    that waste waits for a wet kiss,</br>
    carbon calls me pretty, and i think</br>
    death is a good first date.</p></br>
  <p class="p2">i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</br>
    spares grandpa and his game,</br>
    grandma spinning corn into weight,</p></br>
  <p class="p3">the two of them reeling into western</br>
    theme songs, the TV louder</br>
    than whatever’s coming.</p></br>
