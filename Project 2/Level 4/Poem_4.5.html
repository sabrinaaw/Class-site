  <h2>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h2>
<div> 
  <p style="font-size:5vw;">    
  still, living like they orbit one another,</br>
  my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned</br>
  by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough</br>
  for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,</br>
  
  she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</br>
  talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—</br>
  the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.</br>
  grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.</br>
  
  when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</br>
  will i go taking somebody’s hand,</br>
  my skin becoming their skin?</br>
  the digital age is taking away our winters,</br>
  
  and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</br>
  that waste waits for a wet kiss,</br>
  carbon calls me pretty, and i think</br>
  death is a good first date.</br>
  
  i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</br>
  spares grandpa and his game,</br>
  grandma spinning corn into weight,</br>
  
  the two of them reeling into western</br>
  theme songs, the TV louder</br>
  than whatever’s coming.</br>
