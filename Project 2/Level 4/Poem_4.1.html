    <h1><center>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</center></h1>
  
    <p>
      still, living like they orbit one another,<br />
      my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned <br />
      by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough<br />
      for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,<br />
    </p>
 
    <p>
      <center>she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,<br />
      talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—<br />
      the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.<br />
      grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.</center><br />
    </p>
  
    <p>
      when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?<br />
      will i go taking somebody’s hand,<br />
      my skin becoming their skin?<br />
      the digital age is taking away our winters,<br />
    </p>
 
    <p>
      <center>and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,<br />
      that waste waits for a wet kiss,<br />
      carbon calls me pretty, and i think<br />
      death is a good first date.</center><br />
    </p>
   
    <p>
      i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,<br />
      spares grandpa and his game,<br />
      grandma spinning corn into weight,<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <center>the two of them reeling into western<br />
      theme songs, the TV louder<br />
      than whatever’s coming.</center><br />
