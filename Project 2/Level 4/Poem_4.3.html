  still, living like they orbit </br>
  one another,my grandfather,the </br>
  planet, & grandma, his moon assigned</br>
  by some gravitational pull. </br>
  they have loved long enough</br>
  for a working man to retire. </br>
  grandma says she’s not tired,</br>
  
  she wears her husband like a </br>
  coat that survives every season,</br>
  talks about him the way my </br>
  parents talk about vinyl—</br>
  the subject salvaged by the </br>
  tent of their tongues.</br>
  grandma returns to her love like </br>
  a hymn, marks it with a color.</br>
  
  when the world ends will it suck </br>
  the earth of all its love?</br>
  will i go taking somebody’s hand,</br>
  my skin becoming their skin?</br>
  the digital age is taking away our </br>
  winters, and i’m afraid the sun is </br>
  my soulmate, that waste waits for a </br>
  wet kiss, carbon calls me pretty, and </br>
  i think death is a good first date.</br>
  
  i hope when the world ends it leaves </br>
  them be,spares grandpa and his game,</br>
  grandma spinning corn into weight,</br>
  
  the two of them reeling into </br>
  western theme songs, the TV </br>
  louder than whatever’s coming.</br>
