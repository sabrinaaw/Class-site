    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      <center><i>still, living like they orbit one another,</i></center>
      <center><i>my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned</i></center>
      by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough
      for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,
      
      <center><i>she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</i></center>
      <center><i>talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—</i></center>
      the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.
      grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.
      
      <center> <i>when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</i></center>
      <center><i>will i go taking somebody’s hand,</i></center>
      my skin becoming their skin?
      the digital age is taking away our winters,
      
      <center><i>and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</i></center>
      <center><i>that waste waits for a wet kiss,</i></center>
      carbon calls me pretty, and i think
      death is a good first date.
      
      <center><i>i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</i></center>
      <center><i>spares grandpa and his game,</i></center>
      grandma spinning corn into weight,
      the two of them reeling into western

      <center><i>theme songs, the TV louder</i></center>
      <center><i>than whatever’s coming.</i></center>
    </p>
