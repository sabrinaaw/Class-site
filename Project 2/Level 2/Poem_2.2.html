    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>still</strong>, living like <strong>they orbit one another,</strong><br />
      my grandfather, <strong>the planet</strong>, & grandma, <strong>his moon assigned</strong><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;by <strong>some gravitational pull</strong>. they have loved long enough<br />
      for a working man to retire. grandma says <strong>she’s not tired,</strong><br />
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;she wears her husband <stong>like a coat that survives every season,</stong><br />
      talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.<br />
      grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.</strong><br />
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when the world ends <strong>will it suck the earth of all its love?</strong><br />
      will i go taking somebody’s hand,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;my skin becoming their skin?<br />
      the digital age is taking away our winters,<br />
      
      and <strong>i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</strong><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that waste waits for a wet kiss,<br />
      carbon calls me pretty, and i think<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>death is a good first date.</strong><br />
      
      i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;spares grandpa and his game,<br />
      grandma spinning corn into weight,<br />
      
      <strong>the two of them reeling into western</strong><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;theme songs, the TV louder<br />
      than whatever’s coming.<br />
