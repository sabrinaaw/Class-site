    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
    <strong>still, living like they orbit one another,</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;for a working man to retire. grandma says she’s not tired,<br /> 
      
    <strong>she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;grandma returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.<br /> 
      
    <strong>when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;will i go taking somebody’s hand,<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;my skin becoming their skin?<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;he digital age is taking away our winters,<br /> 
      
    <strong>and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that waste waits for a wet kiss,<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;carbon calls me pretty, and i think<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;death is a good first date.<br /> 
      
    <strong>i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;spares grandpa and his game,<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;grandma spinning corn into weight,<br /> 
      
    <strong>the two of them reeling into western</strong><br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;theme songs, the TV louder<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;than whatever’s coming.<br /> 
    </p>
