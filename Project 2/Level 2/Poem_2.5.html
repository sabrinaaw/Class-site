    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
  
    <p>
      <strong>still, living like they orbit one another,</strong><br />
      <i>my grandfather</i>,    the planet, &    <i>grandma</i>,    his moon assigned<br />
      by some gravitational pull. they have loved long enough<br />
      for a working man to retire.   <i>grandma</i>    says she’s not tired,<br />
    </p>

    <p>  
      <strong>she wears her husband like a coat that survives every season,</strong><br />
      talks about him the way my parents talk about vinyl—<br />
      the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues.<br />
      <i>grandma</i>    returns to her love like a hymn, marks it with a color.<br />
    </p>  

    <p>  
      <strong>when the world ends will it suck the earth of all its love?</strong><br />
      will i go taking somebody’s hand,<br />
      my skin becoming their skin?<br />
      the digital age is taking away our winters,<br />
    </p>  
    
    <p>  
      <strong>and i’m afraid the sun is my soulmate,</strong><br />
      that waste waits for a wet kiss,<br />
      carbon calls me pretty, and i think<br />
      death is a good first date.<br />
    </p>  
    
    <p>  
      <strong>i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</strong><br />
      spares   <i>grandpa</i>   and his game,<br />
      <i>grandma</i>   spinning corn into weight,<br />
    </p>  
    
    <p>  
      <strong>the two of them reeling into western</strong><br />
      theme songs, the TV louder<br />
      than whatever’s coming.<br />
    </p>
