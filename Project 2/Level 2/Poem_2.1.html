    <h1>the world is about to end and my grandparents are in love</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;still, living like they orbit one another, <br />
      </p>

    <p>
      my grandfather, the planet, & grandma, his moon assigned
      by some gravitational pull.<br />
      they have loved long enough for a working man to retire.<br />
      grandma says she's not tired,<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;she wears her husband like a coat thqt survives every season, <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;talks about him the way my parents talk about vinylâ€”<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the subject salvaged by the tent of their tongues. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>grandma returns to her love like a hymn,</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>marks it with color.</strong><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>when the world ends will it suck the earth of all it's love?</i> <br />
      <i>will i go taking somebody's hand,</i> <br />
      <i>my skin becoming their skin?</i> <br />
      <i>the digital age is taking away our winters</i> <br />
      <i>and i'm <strong>AFRAID</strong> the sun is my soulmate,</i> <br />
      <i>that waste waits for a wet kiss,</i> <br />
      <i>carbon calls me pretty, and i think</i> <br />
      <i>death is a good first date.</i> <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>i hope when the world ends it leaves them be,</strong> <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spares grandpa and his game,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granma spinning corn into weight,<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two of them reeling into western<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theme songs, the TV louder<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than whatever's coming.<br />
