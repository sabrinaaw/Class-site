      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan Rethorst sees choreography and dancing, not as an expression of necessarily neatly </br>
      formed ideas, but as a means of discovering things that you didn’t know you knew. It’s about </br>
      finding your own voice. We tend to go with what we already know, the textbook versions of work. </br>
      Follow by the rules that were taught to use, being afraid to go outside those boundaries. </br>
      Rethorst had to excavate from the myths of making, and liberated herself to be able to go out of </br>
      the bounds when it came to choreography and dancing. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling of being bound to one thing and one specific way of thinking is relatable </br>
      within the design world. Such as Rethorst, we’re taught to design a certain way and then we’re </br>
      assigned to create these projects that follow the guidelines of what the professor expects. Being </br>
      told what and what not to do strains creativity. We are being told to use our minds to make </br>
      something wonderful, but we’re also being held from using our uniqueness and creative minds. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rethorst used a lot of outside influence to gain that sense of independence, steering away </br>
      from the myths of dance. Realizing that you don’t have to wait around for some inspiration. She </br>
      began to take a class in the 70s called ‘A Dance A Day’, where you show up to class and create a </br>
      new choreographed dance. It was immediate and terrifying, but it got Rethorst and other students </br>
      to begin using movement in ways that they hadn’t before. You show up and you dance, making a </br>
      dance everyday. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea of making something new everyday, without much thought, is exactly what </br>
      designers attempt to do to get out of our own heads. Rethorst had to create a dance a day, </br>
      whereas myself and other designers can create a design a day, with no restrictions. Being able to l</br>
      et your creative mind free of restricts, is both exciting and challenging. Not being told what to </br>
      do or how to do it isn’t something that we are used to. We’ve been trained to follow orders and </br>
      we do as we are told. Being able to open up to endless possibilities without having to wait for </br>
      inspiration is tough, but it’s the only way to open up a new window of creativeness and </br>
      uniqueness. </br>
